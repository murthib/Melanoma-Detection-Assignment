# Problem Statement

Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

- Dataset being used
  - I have used CNN_assignment.zip file for this analysis

# Steps followed
Steps 
  - Step 1: Read understand and understnad the data
  - Step 2: Data set creation
  - Step 3: Visualize
  - Step 4: Create, train the model and visualize the results
  - Step 5: Data augmentation strategy is applied
  - Step 6: Create, train the model and visualize the results
  - Step 7: Handle class imbalance
  - Step 8: Train the model on the data created using Augmentor
  - Step 9: Create, train the model and visualize the results
  
## Conclusions
- Conclusion:
  - Class imbalance affects the quality of the model
  - A lot of images are needed to train the model
  - Optimum size of epoch was 20 for this given data set
